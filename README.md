# Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000
The HAM10000 dataset is a collection of over 10,000 dermatoscopic images of pigmented skin lesions. This diverse dataset is widely used for academic machine learning research, particularly in the field of skin cancer classification. The goal is to create a practical usage of Image Recognition AI to accurately predict benign and malignant lesions. This was achieved through the deep-learning architecture Resnet50, resulting in an accuracy rate of 89%.

# Data
The data consists of 10015 images of sizes 650x450 with the 3 channels RGB. There are 7 classes, but the data is seriously imbalanced.
